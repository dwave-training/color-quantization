# Image color quantization

This example demonstrates how image color quantization can be solved as a
maximum independent set optimization problem.  The idea behind color
quantization is to reduce the number of distinct colors in an image, while
maintaining visual similarity to the original image.

## Usage

To run the demonstration locally, first install the dependencies (ideally, using a virtual environment):

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then launch Jupyter notebook:

```shell
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a browser where the Jupyter notebook file can be accessed.
